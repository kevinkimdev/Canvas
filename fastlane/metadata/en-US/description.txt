Write with your team, in realtime, using markdown with Canvas. Canvas is the best way to take meeting notes, work on product features, or keep track of those personal notes.

## Realtime Collaboration

Canvas makes it easy to collaborate with anyone in the blink of an eye. Share the link to a canvas with your co-workers and see them show up. Then it’s just a matter of typing.

## Swipe to Format

Use easy swipe gestures to make a checklist, headers and more. Prefer to type? No one likes preview panes. Canvas lets you write Markdown and elegantly folds away the markup when it’s superfluous.

## Find What You’re Looking For

Use blazing fast search to find what you’re looking for without digging through folders.
