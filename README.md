# Canvas

Hacking on the remains of [Canvas](https://github.com/usecanvas). Nothing to see yet.

## Building

First, you’ll need Xcode 9.2 (9C40b). Since there are a lot of targets and hopefully this will one day have other contributors, I’m using [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to generate the Xcode project. [Install it](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen#installing), and then run `xcodegen` in this directory to generate the project.
